# Question 1(a): Version 4.4.2
# Question 1(b): Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20
# Question 1(c): demo(), help(), help.start(), and q()

# Question 2(a): Command + O
# Question 2(b): control + L

# Question 3(a):
1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6
print(1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6)
# Results:
# 1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6 --> 1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6
# print(1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6) --> 1
# Question 3(b): The result of the command corresponds to the print() function.
# This is because 1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6 is just an arithmetic equation that computes
# but does not produce an output to the console while print(1 - 2 + 3 * 4 / 6) 
# produces an output to the console.
